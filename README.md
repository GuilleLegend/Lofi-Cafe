## About
We trained a VAE model in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to represent a lo-fi track as a vector of 100 features. A lo-fi track consists of chords, melodies, and other musical parameters. The web client uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to make a dusty lo-fi track out of these parameters.

## Architecture

* **Client**: The client is written in TypeScript and built with Webpack. It uses Tone.js to generate music.
* **Model**: The model is implemented in PyTorch. We synthesized various datasets, including Hooktheory and Spotify.
* **Server**: The server is a basic Flask instance that deploys the trained model checkpoint. The client communicates with the server using a REST API.

## Setup
If you only want to tinker around with the client, you will only need the `client` folder. This will use the project's server as the backend.

If you want to deploy your own model, you can either train your own model (see the instructions in the `model`) or download the pre-trained checkpoint from [here](https://github.com/jacbz/Lofi/files/7519187/checkpoints.zip). Once you have deployed the server, change the server address inside `client\src\api.ts`.

### Set up the client
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS.
1. Navigate to the client folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run serve` to develop or `npm run build` to build a distributable.

By default, this uses the project's server as the backend. You can also train your own model and deploy your own server.

### Train your own model
See the [model](model) folder for details. Once you have trained your model, put the checkpoint in the `checkpoints` folder.

### Deploy your own server
See the [server](server) folder for details. You can use the provided Dockerfile. Don't forget to change the API url in the client.

## Contributing
Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to [ZOOPRA UG](https://www.zoopra.de/) for hosting the server!
