## Setup
If you only want to tinker around with the client, you will only need the `client` folder. This will use the project's server as the backend.

If you want to deploy your own model, you can either train your own model (see the instructions in the `model`) or download the pre-trained checkpoint from [here](https://github.com/jacbz/Lofi/files/7519187/checkpoints.zip). Once you have deployed the server, change the server address inside `client\src\api.ts`.

### Set up the client
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS.
1. Navigate to the client folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run serve` to develop or `npm run build` to build a distributable.

By default, this uses the project's server as the backend. You can also train your own model and deploy your own server.

### Train your own model
See the [model](model) folder for details. Once you have trained your model, put the checkpoint in the `checkpoints` folder.

### Deploy your own server
See the [server](server) folder for details. You can use the provided Dockerfile. Don't forget to change the API url in the client.
